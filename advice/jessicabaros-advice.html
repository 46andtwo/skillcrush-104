			<h4>Consistancy is Key!</h4>
			<p>This is not something to dabble in; It takes time and dedication</p>
			<p>I've made more progress in the last week than in the two years I've been learning with Skillcrush.</p>

			<h4>The rules are there as a framework.</h4>
			<p>It may feel like coding is so rule specific there is no room for creativity.</p>
			<p>In fact the more rules you learn the more freedom you have! Rules help avoid decision fatigue.</p>
			<p>You need a box if you ever want to be able to think outside of it.</p>
