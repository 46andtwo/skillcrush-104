			<h4>Don't do what I did</h4>
			<p>I used to drink coffee thinking it helped me concentrate, but after way too long I realized it was just causing me massive anxiety. Trying to push yourself to learn code with a body full of caffeine is really not good if you're feeling super stressed and don't seem to be learning much quickly.</p>

			<p>I switched from coffee to rooibos tea and started taking lion's mane mushroom extract and I feel way better and smarter than I ever did trying to jumpstart my brain with coffee. I do miss delicious coffee (although sometimes it disgusted me, which is probably a sign), but I drink Cafix sometimes when I want that flavor...and, I don't care what anyone says, the stuff tastes like coffee. Maybe not your favorite gourmet coffee, but it tastes exactly like and sometimes better than your average NYC deli coffee...which most anyone drinks at some time without any complaints.</p>

			<h4>You know what else I did that you shouldn't do?</h4>
			<p>Yeah, coffee seems inocuous, right? Who could possibly care about coffee? Well, this one is going to seem even more inocuous, then. My next bit of advice is to not try to look at the big picture and become overwhelmed by it. It's really easy to start thinking negatively when you think about all the different code you have to learn.</p>

			<p>Instead, the best piece of advice I got was to get curious about whatever you're trying to learn. Think of it as a game or puzzle or something you're genuinely interested in and approach it every step with curiosity. This is how you learn anything. If you start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated, you know that you're thinking about "big picture" again and you need to just pause, and take a moment to reorient yourself. Forget about the notion that "you'll never get this stuff!" and whatever other exasperated thoughts you're having. Refocus on only what you are looking at and get curious again. Think to yourself, "now how the heck does that work?" or "now why the heck didn't that work?" and just start analyzing what you're doing carefully. This curiosity factor is what naturally happens when we're actually interested in stuff and have no pressing stressful ideas about trying to learn. If you're curious about guitar, you can learn guitar. If you're curious about code, you can learn code.</p>

			<h4>Experiment a lot</h4>
			<p>Practice makes perfect. You can't really learn from just watching videos. You'll never remember anything. Skillcrush follows the best advice for learning, so it's really cool for people who don't know this material.</p>
