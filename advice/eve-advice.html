			<h4>Go slowly!</h4>
			<p>You will be learning so much and many of it will probably be completely new to you. You might feel that because the lessons are straightforward, you should be able to complete them quickly. But don't rush!</p>

			<p>Take time to really make sure that you understand a topic or term before you move on to something else. Otherwise, you might end up starting a project and panicking because you thought you knew what to do but really have no clue how to even begin. And now you have to redo the lessons all over again!</p>

			<h4>Learning a new skill takes time.</h4>
			<p>Most people who code professionally have been doing so for a very long time, so don't feel like you have to catch up with them or learn a lot in a short period. Leave your brain plenty of time to process what it is learning. It's better to know a lot about a little than a little about a lot!</p>
